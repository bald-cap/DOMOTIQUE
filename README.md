# DomotiQue: A Smart Home Simulation Interface

DomotiQue offers an interactive simulation interface for managing virtual radiators and lighting systems across different rooms in a simulated smart home environment. Developed by Michael Kofi Nyanyuie, Bessy Carelle, and Oumou Tabara Diallo, this project serves as an innovative tool for demonstrating the potential of home automation in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

	•	Room Management: Add or remove rooms in your virtual home environment to customize the interface according to your simulation needs.
	•	Lighting Simulation: Control virtual lights, including turning them on/off and adjusting brightness levels for each room.
	•	Radiator Simulation: Manage the temperature settings of virtual radiators in any room, simulating a real-world heating system.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Built with Python and Tkinter, DomotiQue’s GUI is designed for simplicity, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

To use DomotiQue, follow these setup instructions:


## Running the Application

Execute the main script to launch the interface:

python main.py

## How to Use

	•	Start the Interface: Upon launching DomotiQue, you will be presented with the welcome screen.
	•	Manage Rooms: Use the interface to add new rooms or select existing ones for customization.
	•	Control Devices: Within each room, simulate the control of lighting and radiators, adjusting settings as desired.
	•	Real-time Feedback: The interface provides immediate visual feedback on your adjustments to simulate a responsive smart home system.
